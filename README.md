  ## Description
  The purpose of this code is to produce a README.md file  that can be used as a template for building future README.md files. In order to build this template, Node.js 
and Inquirer.js were used to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file. The key areas that can be inputted include the title, a description, installations for installation and usage, licenses that apply, and contact information.
